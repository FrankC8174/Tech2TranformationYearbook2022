# Tech2TranformationYearbook2022
This is a year book of the graduating Tech2Tranformation academy 2022.

The inspiration for this year book came from a employer who requested a site where a face could be linked with a name, as Ron Cofield sought out orginizations seeking fresh tech talent.
The website was a product of three individual design concepts that I saw previoulsy and combined the three.
I wanted to create a "employee directory" type of page highlighting our journey along the way.

I incorporated the parralax effect into this as well. last I started with the design and layout of the card displaying the profile photo, name, and link to their Linkedin Profiles to connect with perspective hires.
